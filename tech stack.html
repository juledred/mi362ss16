The tech fortune 500 company I chose was the apple corporation. In the apple corporation they use swift which “is a robust and intuitive programming language created by Apple for building apps for iOS, Mac, Apple TV, and also the Apple Watch. It’s designed to give developers more freedom than ever. Swift is easy to use and open source, so anyone with an idea can create something incredible. Swift is a fast and efficient language that provides real-time feedback and because of these developers are able to write safer, more reliable code, save time, and create even richer app experiences.” Swift is open source that you use during development and production in the apple corporation. When it comes to deploying code to the web it is mostly through app distribution using a developer id. When using the developer id you can upload metadata about the app so that you can present the application in the app store to the customers and if you are distributing the app outside of the apple store then you need to follow a slightly different process. When it comes to the content delivery network the apple corporation is not a newcomer it was an early user of the technology in 1999 when they invested in the cdn pioneer Akamai. However, in 2014 the apple corporation had built their own cdn and gone live in the U.S and Europe so now they can deliver its own content directly to the consumers on the other end
